# Sports-Analytics-Capstone-Project
## Project Explanation
This project is all about analyzing the history of the Olympic Games using a detailed dataset. The data covers everything from the sports and events to the athletes, medals, and countries involved. By exploring this information, we can discover interesting trends—like which countries or sports have become more popular, how participation has changed, and what factors lead to Olympic success.
## Objective of the Project
The main goal is to get a clear and complete picture of how the Olympics have evolved over time. We want to find patterns in who participates, who wins, which sports are growing or declining, and how different regions are represented. By doing this, we can highlight important moments in Olympic history and suggest ways to make future Games even better—like improving diversity, adding exciting new sports, or making the event more inclusive.
## How This Project Solves Business Problems
This kind of analysis is very useful for organizations like the International Olympic Committee, national sports bodies, and even sponsors. Here’s how:
•	Better Decision-Making: By understanding which sports and countries are growing, organizers can make smarter choices about which events to include or promote.

•	Targeted Marketing: Sponsors and broadcasters can use these insights to focus on sports or regions that are gaining popularity, helping them reach bigger and more engaged audiences.

•	Promoting Diversity: The data can show where representation is lacking, so steps can be taken to encourage more participation from underrepresented regions or groups.

•	Resource Allocation: Countries can see which sports they have potential in and invest more wisely in training and development.

•	Event Planning: Knowing which cities or regions have successfully hosted the Games can help with planning and improving future Olympics.
